This is for the common files.
SF2 and patches are such examples.
They are typically big, so this will help.

Optionally, decompress the patches/common files.
Copy over the patches to the suitable LMMS projects.

If you get soundfont couldn't be loaded warnings,
just ignore them, and obtain them.

These patches are not available in the git repository for reasons
such as size. In this case, look at the attributions and obtain 
yours from there.
